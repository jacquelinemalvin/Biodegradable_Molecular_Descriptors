## Overview
This notebook  
Two classification algorithms are used:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

The notebook includes **feature importance** and **coefficient** plots to visualize how each feature contributes to predictions.

## Steps Performed

1. **Load Dataset**
   - Reads the `qsar_biodeg.csv` file containing molecular descriptors and the target biodegradability class.

3. **Split Data**
   - Uses `train_test_split` to divide the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
   - `stratify=y` ensures class proportions are maintained.
   - `random_state=42` makes the split reproducible.

4. **Scale Features**
   - Standardizes feature values using `StandardScaler` for models sensitive to feature magnitude (e.g., Logistic Regression).

5. **Train Models**
   - **Logistic Regression**:
     - Fits on scaled features.
     - Outputs accuracy and classification report.
   - **Random Forest Classifier**:
     - Fits on unscaled features (tree-based models donâ€™t require scaling).
     - Outputs accuracy and classification report.

6. **Visualize Model Insights**
   - **Random Forest Feature Importance Plot**:
     - Shows which features were most influential in the Random Forest model.
   - **Logistic Regression Coefficient Plot**:
     - Displays how each feature affects the probability of the positive class.
